# Windows Privilege Escalation

## Objective: 
Windows Privilege Escalation, leveraging tools and techniques to gain unauthorized access to system-level resources on a Windows Server machine within a controlled environment. The lab commences with gaining a limited shell via exploiting Jenkins on port 8484, followed by escalating privileges using Juicy Potato. This project provides hands-on experience in exploiting service vulnerabilities, working with Meterpreter shell, and privilege escalation techniques. The ultimate objective is to attain an NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level access, thereby demonstrating the vulnerabilities and the importance of securing Windows systems.
