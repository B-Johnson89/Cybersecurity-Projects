# Mobile Penetration Test

## Objective:

This project focuses on mobile penetration testing, specifically targeting Android devices. The primary goal was to explore vulnerabilities within an Android virtual environment and gain a comprehensive understanding of Android security measuresâ€”or lack thereof. The project involved several core objectives, outlined below:

1. **Android Device Penetration:** Using various tools and methodologies to conduct a penetration test on an Android virtual device.
2. **ADB Integration:** Utilizing the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to establish a connection between a Kali Linux machine and the Android virtual device for deeper inspection and testing.
3. **Information Gathering:** Collecting crucial data about the virtual device, including its brand, model, and name, as well as the list of all installed packages, by executing specific ADB commands.
4. **DIVA App Testing:** Downloading and installing the Damn Insecure and Vulnerable App (DIVA) onto the Android virtual device to examine common vulnerabilities. This involved solving challenges within the app, specifically related to input validation issues.
5. **Documentation and Reporting:** Compiling all steps, methodologies, and findings into a single document, complete with screenshots and explanations, to offer a full view of the penetration testing process and outcomes.
