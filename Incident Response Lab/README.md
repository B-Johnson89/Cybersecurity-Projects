# Incident Response Lab

## Objective: The purpose of this lab is to perform a series of cybersecurity exercises focused on Incident Response. I compromised a virtual machine (LazySysAdmin) using a Kali Linux machine and later conducted a digital forensics investigation utilizing Autopsy. This lab aims to provide hands-on experience in both exploiting vulnerabilities and investigating the corresponding indicators of compromise (IoCs).
