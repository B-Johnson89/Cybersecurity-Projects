# SQL Injection

## Objective:
The objective of this lab is to gain hands-on experience in executing a manual SQL Injection attack against a vulnerable web application, specifically the JuiceShop application. Utilizing BurpSuite as an intercepting proxy, the goal is to trick the JuiceShop server into divulging sensitive information, such as stored usernames and passwords, without using the application's front-end login functionalities. This will be achieved by carefully constructing and injecting SQL queries into the application while monitoring and modifying the web traffic through BurpSuite.
