# Specialized Scanners Lab

## Objective:
Objective: The purpose of this lab is to provide hands-on experience in using specialized scanning tools within a controlled environment. I engaged in scanning and enumerating web services on a Windows platform, using a combination of Nmap, Dirbuster, Nikto, and other specialized tools. The lab is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where understanding and maneuvering around various cybersecurity challenges is crucial. Key tasks include:

1. **Setting Up the Environment:** Utilizing Kali Linux and Metasploitable 3 Windows Machine to create a testbed for scanning exercises.
2. **Web Services Scanning:** Conducting scans on web services, specifically focusing on identifying and analyzing results on port 8585.
3. **Specialized Scanner Usage:** Researching and employing specialized scanners based on the initial scan results, with a focus on in-depth enumeration.
4. **Problem-Solving:** Addressing common issues encountered during scanning, such as non-responsive ports and dependency errors in tools.
